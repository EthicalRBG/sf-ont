# sf-ont
--A generic ontology for solar irradiance forecasting--


The solar forecasting ontology (SF-ONT) developed in this paper integrates knowledge from academic papers, grey literature, and industry, government, and expert papers. This ontology is intended to be used by project developers to compare solar forecasting models, and choose most appropriate model for their use-case scenario, while working within the limitations of data and instrumentation availability.
